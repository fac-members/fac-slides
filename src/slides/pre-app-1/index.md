## Motivation

---

You all have different levels of experience in different areas.

The pre-apprenticeship is designed to ensure everyone starts the course with the coding fundamentals they need.

You will also practice for technical interviews and work on your employment profiles.

---

Some of you have more free time than others.

Please don't use this to try and get ahead.

---

Remember FAC prioritises collective learning over individual goals.

---

## Expectations

---

You're going to be working together for the first time.

Working effectively in a diverse groups requires work.

---

### Recognise the space you take up.

---

If you're extroverted or loud that's okay.

If you're introverted or quiet that's okay too.

We want everyone to have a voice in our discussions and workshops.

---

The onus should not (only) be on quiet people to make themselves heard.

There's limited time and space in groups, especially on Zoom.

Don't use more than your fair share.

---

Please read our Code of Conduct (again).

foundersandcoders.com/code-of-conduct/

Remember this is _the bare minimum_.

It mostly defines unacceptable behaviour, and it's a low bar!

---

## Wednesdays

---

Wednesdays will focus on bridging the gap between the JavaScript you've learnt while working on your applications and what you'll need to start the course.

---

The weeks will alternate between workshop weeks and discussion weeks. There will be some pair programming every week.

---

You are responsible for taking charge of your own learning outside the programme. We'll give you a project to work on each week and some resources to help you.

You're welcome to pair up with each other outside our workshops. As always, be mindful to be inclusive.

---

## Thursdays

---

Focused on preparation for interviews with apprenticeship providers. You'll meet employers, follow our employment curriculum, and work together to practice technical interviews.

---

We'll talk more about Thursdays tomorrow!

---

## Zoom etiquette

---

Please rename yourself to the name you'd like to be called and include your pronouns in brackets.

---

If you have a question or would like to volunteer an answer, raise your hand.

---

Be aware of the space you're taking up on Zoom, only one person can speak at once.

---

## User Manuals

---

When working together, it's useful to know about others' work styles and how we can accomodate one another.

---

Let us know how to say your name and what you'd prefer to be called. If you're happy to share them, include your pronouns too.

---

Thinking about:

- How you get your best work done
- The role you take in a team
- How you communicate
- What you value
- What others might misunderstand about you
- How you like to get feedback
- Where you see your technical strengths
- Your interests

---

User manuals (and other GitHub issues) are written in Markdown!
