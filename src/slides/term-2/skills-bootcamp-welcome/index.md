## Safeguarding

**Safeguarding** is about protecting the health, wellbeing and human rights of all individuals, and in particular about protecting children and vulnerable adults from abuse and neglect.

---

**Prevent** is a government policy intended to safeguard people and communities from the threat of terrorism.

---

If you see or hear anything that concerns your own safety or the safety of others, please use our reporting form to tell us about it.

Doing so will allow us to build up a case file of reported incidents that will help us be better prepared to identify and respond to potential issues in future.

Our safeguarding team is:

- **Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Dan Sofer
- **Deputy Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Gregor Thomson
