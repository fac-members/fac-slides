## Skills Bootcamp

---

This is a part-time course to learn web dev fundamentals.

It is designed to quickly get you to the point of interviewing for software developer apprenticeships.

---

We have partnered with the Department for Education, who are funding the course.

This means we need to report some data back to the government.

This includes info you provided in your application, attendance records, and interview statistics.
