# Pre-apprenticeship

## Wednesday Week 6

---

## Glossary Recap

---

### Scrum(TM)

A widely-used software development method, that uses some of the terms below

---

### Sprint

A fixed period of development time during which the team will not respond to new change requests

---

#### Sprint length

Two weeks is typical in the industry.

During the pre-apprenticeship we will work in one-week sprints.

---

### Backlog

All uncompleted user stories

---

### Sprint backlog

A prioritised backlog of all the user stories that we estimate will be completed in the next sprint, _given each user story estimate and the team's velocity_

---

### Sprint planning

Where the team reprioritises user stories and agrees the next sprint backlog

---

### Sprint review

Where the team compares their _points estimate of each user story with their actual points and adjusts their estimated velocity for the next sprint_

---

### Velocity

The team capacity, expressed in points, for each sprint

---

### Estimate

The difficulty level of a user story, expressed in _points_

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate in _absolute_ time, expressed in hours or half-days, but in order to develop a good sense of _relative_ time, we will estimate our user stories in _points_

---

### Issue labels

---

### Estimates

- `E1` - Short story, estimated
- `E2` - Story, estimated
- `E3` - Long story, estimated
- `E5` - Extra long story, estimated

---

### Actuals

- `A1` - Short story, actual
- `A2` - Story, actual
- `A3` - Long story, actual
- `A5` - Extra long story, actual

---

### Issue types

- `story`
- `chore`
- `bug`
- `refactor`
- `spike`

---

### [Project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)

_"Kanban"_
which you are going to use to track your project

---

### Note

Not all issues raised in the project board contribute to the velocity estimate. **Chores**, **bugs**, **refactors** and **spikes** are all zero-point issues, even though they will (seriously) impact your sprint velocity.

---

### Zero-point issues

- **Chore** Something that needs to be done, not directly related to a user story
- **Bug** Something broken
- **Refactor** An improvement to the code that delivers no change to user experience
- **Spike** Researching a potential solution to a problem by creating the simplest possible implementation of it

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate chores, bugs, refactors and spikes just like user stories, however they might better be thought of as _non-negotiable_ and therefore outside the scope of the sprint planning process.

---

### RECAP

- Scrum(TM)
- Sprint
- Estimate
- Velocity
- Backlog, sprint backlog
- Sprint planning and review
- Project board (_Kanban_)

---

## Today

---

With your partner, work out your actuals for the previous sprint.

---

Use this to calculate your velocity for the next sprint.

---

Review and prune your backlog, what are the highest priority issues leftover from last week.

---

## DOM Challenge

[The challenge](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/dom-challenge/)

---

## Demos

---

Each team has 3 minutes to give us a quick demo of the site they built

---

Talk us through the key functionality

---

Itâ€™s completely normal to find public speaking and giving presentations daunting.

---

See it as an opportunity to practise - and before you know it, giving presentations will be second nature.
