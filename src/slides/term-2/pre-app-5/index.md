title: Pre-Apprenticeship Wednesday Week Five
---

# Pre-apprenticeship

## Wednesday Week 5

---

## Git

---

So far, we've worked on git individually

---

For the next two weeks, you'll work in pairs

---

When working with others, we review one anothers' code and merge it into the main branch

---

## Code review

---

Learn by reading others' code

---

Developers generally spend more of their time reading code than writing it

---

On the apprenticeship programme, you'll review another team's code each week

---

On the pre-apprenticeship, you'll review each others' pull requests

---

## Demo

---

## Glossary

---

### Scrum(TM)

A widely-used software development method, that uses some of the terms below

---

### Sprint

A fixed period of development time during which the team will not respond to new change requests

---

#### Sprint length

Two weeks is typical in the industry. During the pre-apprenticeship we will work in one-week sprints. During the full-time programme, each week we are going to do a single two-day sprint. For your final project, you will be doing one-week sprints.

---

### User story

An action that a user wants to perform

---

### User story

_"As a...
I want...
So that..."_

---

### Backlog

All uncompleted user stories

---

### Sprint backlog

A prioritised backlog of all the user stories that we estimate will be completed in the next sprint, _given each user story estimate and the team's velocity_

---

### Sprint planning

Where the team reprioritises user stories and agrees the next sprint backlog

---

### Sprint retrospective

Stop, go, continue

---

### Sprint review

Where the team compares their _points estimate of each user story with their actual points and adjusts their estimated velocity for the next sprint_

---

### Velocity

The team capacity, expressed in points, for each sprint

---

### Estimate

The difficulty level of a user story, expressed in _points_

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate in _absolute_ time, expressed in hours or half-days, but in order to develop a good sense of _relative_ time, we will estimate our user stories in _points_

---

### Issue labels

---

### Estimates

- `E1` - Short story, estimated
- `E2` - Story, estimated
- `E3` - Long story, estimated
- `E5` - Extra long story, estimated

---

### Actuals

- `A1` - Short story, actual
- `A2` - Story, actual
- `A3` - Long story, actual
- `A5` - Extra long story, actual

---

### Issue types

- `story`
- `chore`
- `bug`
- `refactor`
- `spike`

---

### [Project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)

_"Kanban"_
which you are going to use to track your project

---

### Note

Not all issues raised in the project board contribute to the velocity estimate. **Chores**, **bugs**, **refactors** and **spikes** are all zero-point issues, even though they will (seriously) impact your sprint velocity.

---

### Zero-point issues

- **Chore** Something that needs to be done, not directly related to a user story
- **Bug** Something broken
- **Refactor** An improvement to the code that delivers no change to user experience
- **Spike** Researching a potential solution to a problem by creating the simplest possible implementation of it

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate chores, bugs, refactors and spikes just like user stories, however they might better be thought of as _non-negotiable_ and therefore outside the scope of the sprint planning process.
