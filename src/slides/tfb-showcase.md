## A brief history of Tech for Better

---

### _2015_

Founders and Coders starts offering pro-bono work for non-profits. Due to expectations mismatch, we learned the importance of having clients who understood the application development process.

---

### _2016_

As part of the _CAST Digital Fellowship_, we piloted a series of design and build sprints with a cohort of developers and charities

---

### _2017_

The Digital Fellowship continued with a dedicated team of developers offering consistent programme delivery. The core of this team went on to form the [InFact Co-op](https://www.infactcoop.com/).

---

### _2018_

The Tech for Better programme was initiated, built on our learnings from the last three years. It runs alongside our software developer training as a training programme for Product Owners.

---

Over the first two years of Tech for Better, we learnt that building products is a less urgent need than building expertise within the nonprofit sector.

---

### _2021_

Our core Tech for Better programme connects developers and Product Owners to design, test and build a new digital service.

Through a design sprint and two build sprints, the product team work collaboratively to develop a Minimum Viable Product.

---

This evening, we present four products built as part of our Tech for Better programme

## Tech for Better in 2020-21

---

In March 2020, we collaborated with New Philanthropy Capital on My Best Life Phase 2, involving a series of fully-online collaborative design sprints with three youth charities.

---

Then in May, we applied our learnings from previous engagements to the Collaborative Digital Training programme with CAST.

This programme consolidated our experience of using the design, test and build process as a way to foster collaborative working between charities.

---

In October 2020, we were selected to be a digital partner on the Discovery Learning Programme alongside nine other digital agencies.

On this tailored programme helped guide nine charities with disparate user groups and levels of digital experience through a programme of learning and doing.

---

The most significant impact in 2020 and 2021 on our Tech for Better programme was the funding support provided to us by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.

Alongside this, PHF referred their Ideas and Pioneers grantees to our programme.

---

We have been able to continue developing our Tech for Better programme throughout 2020 and 2021 due to this funding. The funding has directly supported building of ten MVPs, including those presented today. Eight of these were built with Ideas and Pioneers grantees.

---

The programme has provided valuable real-world experience for our developers while they seek full-time employment.

---

Alongside this, the funding supported us to maintain our current core team at Founders and Coders as we made the move to being an apprenticeship training provider.

---

By the end of March 2021, we had secured our first apprenticeships for seven developers on our full-time programme.

---

All developers who completed our programme without an apprenticeship or an offer of full-time employment have been offered the opportunity to work on Tech for Better projects.

---

## The future of Tech for Better

---

For our next full-time cohort, beginning in September 2021, we are aiming to secure up to twelve apprenticeships

---

This will involve a significant move away from developers seeking employment once completing their training to finding employment before and supporting their training.

---

This means that the focus and needs of the Tech for Better programme shift...

---

We have consistently identified a need in the third sector for Product Management training and experience in working alongside development teams.

---

We will be expanding the training offering to Product Owners and piloting a support system for them to identify their next steps beyond Tech for Better

---

We are seeking further opportunities to grow what Tech for Better can offer to the third sector and to developers.

We plan to set up a digital agency that will offer a 'Tech for Better apprenticeship' to developers
