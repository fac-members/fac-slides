## Roles

---

You'll take turns filling three roles at a meetup:

- Leader
- Supporter
- Observer

---

You'll work together in rounds, each will last 20 minutes and once the time is up, you'll switch roles.

---

### Leader

- Shares their screen
- Presents a challenge
- Codes with help from the Supporter

---

### Supporter

- Starts by reading and understanding the problem
- Guides towards a solution
- Focuses on asking questions to the leader
- Supports the leader to solve the problem

---

### Observer

- Provides feedback to the leader and supporter
- Is quiet during the coding and gives space to the others
- Gives constructive feedback at the end of the round

---

### What to focus on

- Was the person in the supporting role supportive?
- Did the Leader listen well to the Supporter?
- What was missing from the eventual solution?
- What could be done differently next time?

---

### Mentor

- Supports everyone to work together
- Doesn't give all the answers
- Can help prompt towards a solution or give hints
- Keeps an eye on time

---

## Today, I Learned...

---

At the end of the session, we'll ask each person to share a Today I Learned.

Let everyone know something new you discovered during the session or some knowledge you have to share with the group.
