## Roles

---

You'll take turns filling three roles at a meetup: Leader, Supporter and Observer. Each round will last 20 minutes and once the time is up, you'll switch roles.

---

### Leader

The Leader shares their screen and presents a challenge which is then discussed with the Supporter.

---

### Supporter

Starts by ensuring that they fully understand the challenge being presented by reading or describing for the whole group the information they see on the Leaderâ€™s screen.

The person in the supporting role should focus on asking questions of the person in the leading role, rather than directly providing solutions.

---

### Observer

The Observer's role is to provide constructive feedback to both the Leader and Supporter at the end of the round.

Was the person in the supporting role supportive and did they at any point step out of role and offer solutions? What was missing from the eventual solution that either the Leader or the Supporter missed?

---

### Mentor

Your mentor will be there to support you working together. It's important to see them as supporting you rather than providing all the answers. They may prompt you towards a solution or give you a hint.

---

Your mentor will keep a close eye on time and ensure there's time given for the observer to provide feedback at the end of each round. They also might support you with finding problems to work on, if you aren't sure what to cover.

---

## Today, I Learned...

---

At the end of the session, we'll bring everyone back to the main room. We'll ask each room to share a Today I Learned - a short summary of something new you discovered during the session or a piece of knowledge you'd like to share with the group.
