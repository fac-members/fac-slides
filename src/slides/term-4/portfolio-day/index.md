# Portfolio Day

Autumn '22

---

The apprenticeship is assessed in two ways:

- Project (‚ÄúWork-based project with questioning‚Äù)
- Portfolio (‚ÄúProfessional discussion underpinned by portfolio‚Äù)

---

When you enter EPA gateway we must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio
- _Evidence of Level 2 English_
- _Evidence of Level 2 Maths_
- _Sign-off from your employer_

You can only enter the Gateway period when these are ready

---

Founders and Coders will support you throughout the lead up to and during EPA gateway

---

Each term, Gregor is available for regular check-ins and portfolio feedback

We'll also hold 'tripartite reviews' between you, your employer, and us

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines 50% of your grade.

---

The portfolio 'typically' contains 10 pieces of evidence

---

Each should relate to at least one of the required knowledge, skills or behaviours. And most likely, they'll cover many.

---

There is no specific structure for the documentation

---

Evidence is documentation which:

1. Summarises a work project
1. Describes all the ways **you** met the required knowledge, skills & behaviours
1. Includes code samples, screenshots of plans/issues/stories, architecture diagrams etc

---

Build your portfolio throughout your apprenticeship

## Additional guidance

---

Focus on **WHAT** you did and **HOW** you did it.

**WHO** is important too - but your assessor will be looking to hear what **you** did, so always use **I, me, my** and avoid **we, us, our**.

Also consider, **WHY** you are making the technical decisions that you are.

---

- WHAT
- HOW
- WITH WHOM
- WHY

---

Put together a narrative of what you did on the project, and use supporting evidence.

Mapping to KSBs comes after documenting, and in a separate document.

---

## Mapping

---

Put together a separate document with a table

---

| KSB | Definition                                                                                                              | Evidence                      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| K1  | All stages of the software development life-cycle (what each stage contains, including the inputs and outputs)          | Update contact form - Page 2  |
| K3  | The roles and responsibilities of the project life-cycle within your organisation, and your role                        | New login modal - Page 4      |
| K4  | How best to communicate using the different communication methods and how to adapt appropriately to different audiences | Update contact form - Page 10 |
| ... |                                                                                                                         |                               |

---

_Map to KSBs and not criteria_

---

The mapping is where you feel you've met the criteria.

In your evidence you don't need to respond directly to each KSB. Follow a _documentation first_ approach.

---

## Questions

---

## Project

---

The aim of the project is to research and develop a software solution to meet a specification provided by a customer or other stakeholder.

---

The project should:

- meet the needs of your employer
- be relevant to your role
- demonstrate the required knowledge, skills & behaviours

---

The project is submitted in the form of a 4,500 word report.

It has a set structure with sections for each part of the software development lifecycle.

---

Appendices do not count towards the word count

---

The report, and the questioning will inform your grade

---

## Questions

---

## EPA

---

BCS require 10 working days to approve or reject a gateway request

During this time, they assess the project summary, review the portfolio, and give advice

---

Qualifications must be submitted to enter gateway, whether you went to school in the UK or not

---

The maximum time from entering gateway to completing your project report is 9 weeks. If you don't meet the deadline, you fail üôÄ

---

Assessment will be booked within a few weeks of the project report coming back

Portfolio assessment may happen during the 9 weeks

---

During the portfolio assessment, they want you to talk about all 21 criteria. They may cut you off - this is not a bad thing.

---

The portfolio documentation (and project summary, report, etc.) must be uploaded to the assessment platform

---

This means no external links, and... no Notion üò•
