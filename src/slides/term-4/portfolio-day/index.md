# Portfolio Day

Summer '22

---

To complete your apprenticeship, you'll be assessed in two ways:

- Project (‚ÄúWork-based project with questioning‚Äù)
- Portfolio (‚ÄúProfessional discussion underpinned by portfolio‚Äù)

---

When you enter EPA gateway you must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio

So you should only start assessment when these are ready.

---

Founders and Coders will support you throughout the lead up and during EPA gateway. We'll hold 'tripartite reviews' between you, your employer, and us.

These will be (roughly) every 4 months.

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines your grade.

---

The portfolio should contain (up to) 10 pieces of evidence.

Each should relate to at least one of the required knowledge, skills or behaviours. And most likely, they'll cover many.

---

Evidence is documentation which:

1. Summarises each of your work projects
1. Describes all the ways **you** met the required knowledge, skills & behaviours
1. Includes code samples, screenshots of plans/issues/stories, architecture diagrams etc

---

Build your portfolio throughout your apprenticeship.

## Additional guidance

---

Focus on **WHAT** you did and **How** you did it.

**WHO** is important too - but your assessor will be looking to hear what **you** did, so always use **I, me, my** and avoid **we, our, us**.

---

Put together a narrative of what you did on the project, and use supporting evidence.

Mapping to KSBs comes after documenting, and in a separate document.

## Questions

---

## Learning diary

---

Alongside your work, you'll spend time learning _on the job_

üíºüìö

---

Keep a record of what you learn as you go, you're likely to encounter new technologies and working with different stacks throughout the apprenticeship

---

Your manager or mentor might write a learning plan with you

---

You may also record the time you spend learning. This can be submitted to the ESFA on completion of your apprenticeship

---

## Project

---

The aim of the project is to research and develop a software solution to meet a specification provided by a customer or other stakeholder.

---

The project should:

- meet the needs of your employer
- be relevant to your role
- demonstrate the required knowledge, skills & behaviours

---

The project is submitted in the form of a 4,500 word report.

It has a set structure with sections for each part of the software development lifecycle.

---

Think of it as an extended version of your TFB documentation
