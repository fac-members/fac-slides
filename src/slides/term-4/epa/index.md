# End-point assessment

---

All apprentices must be formally assessed.

---

This checks you've learnt everything you need to be a dev.

These are defined in the Apprenticeship Standard.

---

Don't panic! We know you're good developers.

We just need to make sure the assessors can see that too.

---

## When can you start assessment?

---

You can start the process after 12 months of apprenticeship.

Starting your assessment period is known as "EPA gateway".

This should generally take under 6 months.

---

Your employer makes the final decision on whether you're ready.

---

You must have English and maths at Level 2. E.g.

- GCSE grade C
- International Baccalaureate grade 4
- Any UK Bachelor's/Masters/Postgraduate degree
- Various certifications (NVQ, Functional Skills etc)

---

You will be assessed in two ways:

- Project ("Work-based project with questioning")
- Portfolio ("Professional discussion underpinned by portfolio")

---

There are 3 possible grades for each: fail, pass, or distinction.

Performance in these determine your overall apprenticeship grade: fail, pass, merit, or distinction.

---

When you enter EPA gateway you must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio

So you should only start assessment when these are ready.

---

## Project

---

The aim of the project is to research and develop a software solution to meet a specification provided by a customer or other stakeholder.

---

The project should:

- meet the needs of your employer
- be relevant to your role
- demonstrate the required knowledge, skills & behaviours

---

The project is submitted in the form of a 4500 word report.

It has a set structure with sections for each part of the software development lifecycle.

---

You can have worked in a team on the project, but the report must be solely your work.

---

### Marking

---

The assessor will review and mark your report.

---

You will also have a 60 minute question session with the assessor.

They will ask at least 12 questions about the project to assess your learnings.

---

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which is what determines your grade.

---

The portfolio should contain 10 pieces of evidence.

Each should relate to at least one of the required knowledge, skills or behaviours.

---

The portfolio should contain:

- evidence of work projects completed
- written accounts of activities
- photographic evidence and work products
- work instructions
- technical reports
- progress review documentation
- witness testimonies
- feedback from colleagues

---

The porfolio should **not** contain:

- reflective accounts
- self-assessments

---

If your work is confidential you can ask the assessor to review the porfolio at your employer's premises only.

---

### Marking

---

The portfolio itself is not marked.

Instead it is used as the basis for a discussion.

---

The professional discussion will last 60 minutes.

It is supposed to be a 1:1 conversation where you use your portfolio as evidence.
