# Starting the apprenticeship

---

I hope you're all now settling in to your new roles!

---

We're gonna run through EPA and what support we'll offer throughout the apprenticeship

---

## EPA

---

Two components:

- Portfolio
- Project report

---

Portfolio is completed throughout the apprenticeship

---

Project is built and documented at the end of the apprenticeship

---

## Portfolio

---

Write documentation about your work throughout the apprenticeship

---

This will be relevant to a set of KSBs

---

Map to the KSBs

---

There's no template for documentation

---

Use Google Doc's, and I can give feedback

---

We'll support you throughout with portfolio peer groups

---

## Portfolio peer groups

---

Once every 4 weeks

---

5 or 6 apprentices from a mix of cohorts

---

2 hours, before or after lunch

---

Work on your portfolio and get feedback from your peers and me

---

**The portfolio is the most important thing to focus on during the first 6 months in employment**

---

## Final project

---

...

---

## Tripartite reviews

---

Employer, apprentice and training provider

---

Every 4 months

---

Check in on apprenticeship progress
