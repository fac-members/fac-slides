# Starting the apprenticeship

---

I hope you're all now settling in to your new roles!

---

We're gonna run through EPA and what support we'll offer throughout the apprenticeship

---

## EPA

---

The apprenticeship is assessed in two ways:

- Project (“Work-based project with questioning”)
- Portfolio (“Professional discussion underpinned by portfolio”)

---

You'll work on your portfolio throughout the apprenticeship

---

The project is built and documented after passing through EPA Gateway

---

EPA Gateway can be entered 12 months from _starting_ the apprenticeship

For your cohort, this is from 20 September 2023

---

When you enter EPA gateway we must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio
- _Evidence of Level 2 English_
- _Evidence of Level 2 Maths_
- _Sign-off from your employer_

You can only enter the Gateway period when these are ready

---

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines 50% of your grade.

---

You'll write up evidence of what you've been working on as you go through the apprenticeship

---

Your evidence relates to a set of knowledge, skills and behaviours set out in the apprenticeship standard

---

There's no template for documentation

Use Google Doc's, and I can give feedback

---

[fac-standard](https://fac-standard.netlify.app/)

---

You'll put together a [mapping document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0lBLApi-JzdF5a73e-Eg_iXTsT1XqJWfZbIy4bhV7o/edit?usp=sharing) which lists the KSBs and where you feel you've met them in your portfolio evidence

---

Evidence is documentation which:

1. Summarises a work project
1. Describes all the ways **you** met the required knowledge, skills & behaviours
1. Includes code samples, screenshots of plans/issues/stories, architecture diagrams etc

---

Spend 30 - 60 minutes each week working on your portfolio

---

## Additional guidance

---

Focus on **WHAT** you did and **HOW** you did it.

**WHO** is important too - but your assessor will be looking to hear what **you** did, so always use **I, me, my** and avoid **we, us, our**.

Also consider, **WHY** you are making the technical decisions that you are.

---

- WHAT
- HOW
- WITH WHOM
- WHY

---

Put together a narrative of what you did on the project, and use supporting evidence.

Mapping to KSBs comes after documenting, and in a separate document.

---

We'll support you throughout with _portfolio peer groups_

---

## Portfolio peer groups

---

Once every 4 weeks, you'll meet with other apprentices for dedicated portfolio time

---

2 hours, before or after lunch

---

Work on your portfolio and get feedback from your peers and me

---

**The portfolio is the most important thing to focus on during the first 6 months in employment**

---

## Final project

---

The aim of the project is to research and develop a software solution to meet a specification provided by a customer or other stakeholder.

---

The project should:

- meet the needs of your employer
- be relevant to your role
- demonstrate the required knowledge, skills & behaviours

---

The project is submitted in the form of a 4,500 word report.

It has a set structure with sections for each part of the software development lifecycle.

---

The project is 9 weeks in length

Roughly, 7 weeks of coding and 2 of reporting

---

Appendices do not count towards the word count

---

The report, and the questioning will inform your grade

---

## Tripartite reviews

---

Employer, apprentice and training provider

---

Every 4 months
