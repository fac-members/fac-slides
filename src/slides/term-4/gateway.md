# End-Point Assessment and Gateway

---

EPA Gateway can be entered anytime after 12 months from starting the apprenticeship

You can enter from 10 May onwards

---

The _Gateway_ is a point of access to EPA

---

Essentially, you submit your documentation and BCS will approve or deny your request to start your final project

---

We will submit, on your behalf:

- English and Maths qualifications
- A complete portfolio of evidence (and mapping)
- Project summary and mapping
- Sign-off forms

---

## Gateway period

---

Once we've submitted all documentation at Gateway, we wait 10 working days for approval

---

If a request is denied, we'll get a clear steer on why it has been.

We haven't yet had someone denied entry through Gateway

---

After those 10 days, you'll be able to start your final project

---

## Portfolio

---

Documentation of what you've worked on throughout your apprenticeship

---

There's no typical length for the portfolio. We've seen documentation in the range of 20 - 80 pages, or 5,000 - 15,000 words.

---

- WHAT
- HOW
- WITH WHOM
- WHY

---

Map to the KSBs in an appendix

We need to submit your [mapping document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0lBLApi-JzdF5a73e-Eg_iXTsT1XqJWfZbIy4bhV7o/edit?usp=sharing) which will give an indication to the assessor on where you feel you've met the KSB

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines 50% of your grade.

---

### Portfolio assessment

---

A conversation about your portfolio

---

Questions focus on the _criteria_ which relate to the KSBs

---

You'll be asked a minimum of 12 questions, and the assessment is 60 minutes

---

Only what you say will be assessed, you must articulate something for it to count

---

We'll hold mock assessment sessions in May to get ready for Gateway

---

## Final project

---

The final project must be something:

- Useful to the employer (or a client of)
- Scoped to meet the relevant KSBs
- Achievable within a 7 week window of development

---

At Gateway, an apprentice will submit a summary of what the project will be and mapping to a set of KSBs

---

---

Your project **must** be submitted within 9 weeks of starting

---

Roughly, 7 weeks are spent working on the project and 2 weeks documenting

---

I'd strongly suggest that you write every week and not all at the end

---

## Sign-off

---

We submit two forms at Gateway:

- Employer sign-off
- Gateway readiness form

---

An apprentice requires approval from their employer that they feel the apprentice is ready to be assessed
