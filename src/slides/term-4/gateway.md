# End-Point Assessment and Gateway

---

EPA Gateway can be entered anytime after 12 months from starting the apprenticeship

---

The _Gateway_ is a point of access to EPA

---

Essentially, you submit your documentation and BCS will approve or deny your request to start your final project

---

I will submit, on your behalf:

- English and Maths qualifications
- A complete Portfolio of evidence (and mapping)
- Project summary and mapping
- Sign-off forms

---

## Gateway period

---

Once we've submitted all documentation at Gateway, we wait 10 days for approval

---

If a request is denied, we'll get a clear steer on why it has been.

We have submitted documentation for most of the previous cohort and have a good sense of what is required.

---

After those 10 days, you'll be able to start your final project

---

## Portfolio

---

Documentation of what you've worked on throughout your apprenticeship

---

There's no typical length for the portfolio. We've seen documentation in the range of 20 - 80 pages, or 5,000 - 15,000 words.

---

- What
- How
- With whom
- Why

---

Map to the KSBs in an appendix

We need to submit your mapping document which will give an indication to the assessor on where you feel you've met the KSB

---

A reminder that the portfolio is not directly assessed, but will form the basis of the assessment

---

### Portfolio assessment

---

A conversation about your portfolio

---

Questions focus on the _criteria_ which related to the KSBs

---

You'll be asked a minimum of 12 questions, and the assessment is 60 minutes

---

Only what you say will be assessed, you must articulate something for it to count

---

As of yet, we haven't had anyone sit the assessment. This is likely to change in the next couple of months.

---

We'll hold some prep sessions for EPA:

- Portfolio peer groups (Tuesday 17 Jan)
- Mock assessments (Tuesday 31 Jan and 7 Feb)

---

## Final project

---

The final project must be something:

- Useful to the employer (or a client of)
- Scoped to meet the relevant KSBs
- Achievable within a 7 week window of development

---

At Gateway, an apprentice will submit a summary of what the project will be and mapping to a set of KSBs

---

---

Your project **must** be submitted 9 weeks after entering EPA

---

Roughly, 7 weeks are spent working on the project and 2 weeks documenting

---

I'd strongly suggest that you write every week and not all at the end

---

## Sign-off

---

We submit two forms at Gateway:

- Employer sign-off
- Gateway readiness form

---

An apprentice requires approval from their employer that they feel the apprentice is ready to be assessed

---

That's it...
