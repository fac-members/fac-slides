You will be assessed in two ways:

- Project (‚ÄúWork-based project with questioning‚Äù)
- Portfolio (‚ÄúProfessional discussion underpinned by portfolio‚Äù)

---

When you enter EPA gateway you must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio

So you should only start assessment when these are ready.

---

Founders and Coders will support you throughout the lead up and during EPA gateway. We'll hold 'tripartite reviews' between you, your employer, and us.

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines your grade.

---

The portfolio should contain (up to) 10 pieces of evidence.

Each should relate to at least one of the required knowledge, skills or behaviours. And most likely, they'll cover many.

---

The portfolio should contain:

- evidence of work projects completed
- written accounts of activities
- photographic evidence and work products
- progress review documentation
- feedback from colleagues

---

In plain English this means writing documenation which:

1. Summarises each of your work projects
1. Describes all the ways **you** met the required knowledge, skills & behaviours
1. Includes code samples, screenshots of plans/issues/stories, architecture diagrams etc

---

You can probably cover most of the KSBs with only a few projects.

---

Build your portfolio throughout your apprenticeship.

The project should:

- meet the needs of your employer

The project is submitted in the form of a 4500 word report.

It has a set structure with sections for each part of the software development lifecycle.
