### Product Showcase

## An introduction to Tech for Better

---

Tech for Better is immersive training in Product Management for social entrepreneurs, charities and start-ups

---

Through hands on experience of working with developers, Product Owners learn about:

- User Research
- Scoping a Product
- Working with developers

---

Our apprentice developers build MVPs as part of the Design, Test and Build programme in collaboration with Product Owners

---

These products are what we'll see showcased this evening

## Tech for Better in 2023

---

The upfront training of our apprenticeship concludes with completing the Tech for Better project. These give our developers an opportunity to work on a real world project with an external client.

---

We have consistently identified a need in the third sector for Product Management training and experience working directly with developers

---

We've run a number of bespoke training programmes for Product Owners in the past and we're excited to have integrated these to our core Tech for Better programme

---

We'll be running another round of training next term!
