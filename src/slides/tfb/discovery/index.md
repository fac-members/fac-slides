## Tech for Better

# Discovery

---

Discovery is about exploring the problem space, and understanding the user group

---

Before conducting research, we examine what we know about our users and the problem they're facing

---

Throughout the software development cycle, we focus on the user and put them at the centre of every decision

---

## Agile development

---

Agile product development is an iterative process rooted in user feedback and adaptation

---

Product teams reduce waste through early and consistent user validation

---

Each iteration of a product idea is refined and validated through research or testing with the user group

---

![Agile software development analogy. The image shows a car built in stages, without scope for user feedback until the product is finished. The second panel showsbuilding a skateboard, then a bike, and then a convertible and getting feedback at every stage.](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-sense-of-MVP-.jpg)

## Today

---

In small groups, you'll work through exercises on Miro

---

You'll refine and solidify the Problem Statement

---

You'll create a user persona which describes a typical service user

---

Finally, you'll write up questions for the user group. These will form the basis of our Product Owners' user interviews.
