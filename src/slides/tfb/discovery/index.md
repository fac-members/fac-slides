## Tech for Better

# Discovery

---

Discovery is about exploring the problem space, and understanding the user group

---

Before conducting research with users, we examine what we know about the problem(s) they're facing

---

Throughout the software development cycle, we focus on the user and put them at the centre of every decision

---

## Agile development

---

Agile product development is an iterative process rooted in user feedback and adaptation

---

Product teams reduce waste through early and consistent user validation

---

Each iteration of a Product idea is validated through research or testing with the user group. The idea is refined at every stage

---

![Agile software development analogy. The image shows a car built in stages, without scope for user feedback until the product is finished. The second panel showsbuilding a skateboard, then a bike, and then a convertible and getting feedback at every stage.](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-sense-of-MVP-.jpg)

## Today

---

We'll first communicate and solidify our Problem Statement

---

Individually, you'll write up user personas. Then as a group, you'll introduce each other to your assumption of who a user might be.

---

Finally, you'll write up questions for the user group. These will form the basis of our Product Owners' user interviews.
