### Design, Test and Build

_(17 July -> 3 August)_

- One design sprint
- Two build sprints
- Test a prototype with a real user group
- Work with a Product Owner to build an MVP

---

At the end of the programme, you'll present your product at the Tech for Better showcase

---

## What makes a good Product Owner?

---

- A clear vision for the product
- They listen and collaborate
- They know their user group
- Decisive, but flexible
- Enthusiastic

---

## What to look for

---

- Focus on the problem, not the solution
- Do they communicate the problem well?
- Who are the users? Does the PO know them?
- What does the PO hope to achieve in the long term?
- What would the PO do after the MVP has been built?
- What are their expectations?
