## Tech for Better

# Product pitches

---

Today we'll hear from each Product Owner about their digital product idea

---

We'll then split into rotating breakout rooms for Q&A sessions

---

In each breakout room, we'll have a Product Owner and a group of developers.

Developers will take turns asking questions and getting a deeper sense of the product idea.

---

The goal is not to find a solution to the problem immediately

---

Instead:

- get a good idea of who the user group is
- what problem they're facing
- how that problem affects the user group
- and how building a digital product will benefit the user group

---

Product Owners will move around different breakout rooms and meet new groups of developers

---

Once we’ve completed the rounds of pitches, everyone will return to the main room

Here we’ll hear reflections from each Product Owner

---

The problem statement:

- Who are your users?
- What do they need?
- How will responding to their need benefit them?
