## Tech for Better

# Analysis Workshop

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

---

Today we'll take a deeper look at your product idea and analyse what you'll build

---

## Mapping the Journey

---

Plan the main path through the application, considering 3 areas:

- Discovery: how will users find your service
- Learning: how will users find out what the service offers and how to use it
- Using: what are the regular steps the user will take when using the app

---

Discovery is the least important step for us on the programme. Itâ€™s worth considering but not for more than a minute or two.

---

## How Might We?

---

Think about the key challenges of building a Product which will respond to the user needs identified

---

Ask questions, not worrying about finding all the answers now. For example:

- What technical challenges will there be?
- How will we manage data?
- What do we not know how to achieve?

---

## Consequence Scanning

---

Everything we build will have an impact on the world

It's important that we consider the consequences of what we build

---

- What are the intended and unintended consequences of this product or feature?
- What are the positive consequences we want to focus on?
- What are the negative consequences we want to mitigate?

---

Next Tuesday morning, you'll conduct testing with real users.

Please arrange for up to 6 people to be available for the session.
