## An introduction to Tech for Better

---

Tech for Better teaches Product Management to social entrepreneurs, charities and start-ups through hands-on experience

---

Our apprentice developers build MVPs as part of the Design, Test and Build programme in collaboration with Product Owners

---

Last year, we introduced a new series of workshops and exercises designed as immersive training in Product Management, offered for free to a cohort of Product Owners

---

These workshops are built from previous iterations of Tech for Better and our other engagements in the social sector; and rooted in our principles of peer-led learning

---

- Product Pitches
- Discovery Workshop
- User Research
- Analysing Research
- Managing and scoping a Product

---

Iterating on this training has given us scope to adapt and tailor the programme to the needs of our Product Owners and Developers

---

After this series of workshops, we select Product ideas to design, test and build

---

These products are what we'll see showcased this evening

## Tech for Better in 2022

---

The upfront training of our apprenticeship concludes with completing the Tech for Better project. These give our developers an opportunity to work on a real world project with an external client.

---

We have consistently identified a need in the third sector for Product Management training and experience working directly with developers

---

We've run a number of bespoke training programmes for Product Owners in the past and we're excited to have integrated these to our core Tech for Better programme

---

We'll be running another round of training in January with FAC26!
