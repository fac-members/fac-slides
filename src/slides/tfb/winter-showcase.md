## An introduction to Tech for Better

---

A programme for founders, social entrepreneurs and charity workers to learn Product Management by working with a Product Team to design, test and build a new digital service

---

We're excited to have been able to bring Tech for Better back into our full-time programme

---

Previously, developers who completed the programme without an apprenticeship or an offer of full-time employment would have been offered the opportunity to work on Tech for Better projects

---

We've been grateful to the Paul Hamlyn Foundation in supporting the programme over the past year and a half

---

This year, we introduced a new series of workshops and exercises designed as immersive training in Product Management, offered for free to a cohort of Product Owners

---

These workshops are built from previous iterations of Tech for Better and our engagements on Catalyst training programmes; and rooted in our principles of peer-led learning

---

- Product Pitches
- Discovery Workshop
- User Research
- Analysing Research
- Managing a Product

---

After this series of workshops, we selected two MVPs to design, test and build

---

These two products are what we'll see showcased this evening

## Tech for Better in 2022

---

Apprenticeships involve a significant move: away from developers seeking employment after completing their training; towards finding employment before and supporting their training.

---

This means that the focus and needs of the Tech for Better programme have shifted...

---

We have consistently identified a need in the third sector for Product Management training and experience in working alongside development teams

---

We continue to iterate on the training offering to Product Owners and develop the programme into a full experience for Product Owners

---

Alongside this, we're offering developers the opportunity to gain real-world development experience as part of their apprenticeship training
