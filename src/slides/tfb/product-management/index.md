## Product Manager

---

The role of Product Manager is to be 'the CEO of the Product'.

---

The key to their role is holding the vision of the Product and ensure that the team is able to make progress towards that vision.

---

Their task is to spot ideas that won't work early in the process, reduce the risk of failure, and make sure the organisation is learning at every stage of development.

---

## Product Manager vs. Product Owner

---

There is a difference between the roles of Product Manager and Product Owner.

---

Being Product Manager involves leading on managing the development of a digital product. This role is typically used to describe someone who is familiar with modern methods of project management, particularly in the area of software development.

---

The Product Owner is the single source of information for a product development team about the product they are trying to build. This term comes from the Scrum method that is widely used in software development and that we use at Founders and Coders.

---

All good Product Managers should be good at playing the role of Product Owner. It is one of their 6 key competencies.

## Sprint planning

---

In this ceremony, the Product Owner and Product Team work together to prioritise issues for the next sprint.

---

Each story in the sprint backlog has a priority - usually Low, Medium or High

---

Each story has an estimation of complexity representing how much time it will take to complete

---

Add priority labels (L, M, H) and estimates (1, 2, 3, 5) to each story

---

We'll now plan our next sprint!

---

Imagine your team's velocity is the total estimates divided by 2

---

Choose which stories will go into the first sprint
