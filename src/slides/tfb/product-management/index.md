## Product Manager vs. Product Owner

---

There is a difference between the roles of Product Manager and Product Owner.

---

Being **Product Manager** involves leading on managing the development of a digital product. This role encompasses all the responsibilities of digital Product Building: from stakeholder engagement, to securing funding.

---

The **Product Owner** is the single source of information for a product development team about the product they are trying to build. This term comes from the Scrum method that is widely used in software development and that we use at Founders and Coders.

All good Product Managers should be good at playing the role of Product Owner. It is one of their 6 key competencies.
