# Research Analysis

---

Today, we'll explore what Product Owners found out during their user research

---

We'll split into groups. Each will have 2 Product Owners, and 3 Developers.

---

You'll complete these steps:

1. Write notes on what came out of the research
1. Theme those notes
1. Write insight statements to summarise the notes

---

## Writing notes

Both Product Owners summarise their research and add notes to Miro under specific headings

---

## Theming notes

As a group, think of themes to summarise the findings of each PO's research

---

## Insights

Looking at the themes, ask 'What does this mean?'

Summarise the themes with statements analysing their content

---

Product Owners will take turns completing each step before moving to the next one

---

You'll have 10 minutes for each PO to complete each step
