## Agile software development

Agile product development is an iterative process rooted in user feedback and adaptation.

Product teams reduce waste through early user validation.

---

We focus on the user first and throughout.

Services we design must respond to the needs of the user.

---

Before we embark on building a product, we spend time conjuring ideas through a _Design Sprint_.

---

The Design Sprint as most people understand it comes from the [Google Ventures Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/).

---

The Google Ventures team defines a design sprint as a 5-day process having 5 phases: _Understand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype, Test_.

---

We are not going to follow the Google Ventures sprint precisely. We are going to treat the design sprint as a 4-step process.

---

1. Discover
2. Analyse
3. Define
4. Prototype
5. Test

---

## 1. Discover

---

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Whose needs are you trying to address?
- What is your understanding of their needs?
- Are your assumptions about their needs correct?
- What are your measures of success in meeting those needs?

---

### Primary activities

- Qualitative user research

- User Interviews

- Quantitative user research

- Collecting survey responses

---

### Primary outputs

- Problem statement
- User personas
- Research data

---

## 2. Analyse

---

- What have we identified from conducting research?

- What does the user journey look like?

- How might we meet the user need?

- What are the consequences of this product?

- What are the main technical challenges of the build?

---

### Primary activities

- Research Synthesis
- Mapping the Journey
- Consequence Scanning

---

### Primary outputs

- A clear User Journey

---

## 3. Define

---

- What can give us inspiration for our product?
- What might our solution look like?

---

### Primary activities

- Idea generation
- Sketching
- Decision making

---

### Primary outputs

- Low-fidelity prototypes

---

## 4. Prototype

---

- What might the solution look like?

---

### Primary activities

- High-fidelity prototyping

---

### Primary output

- A high-fidelity prototype

---

## 5. Test

---

What do users think of the prototype?

---

### Primary activity

- Qualitative user testing

---

### Primary output

- A validated prototype

---

## Recap

1. Discover
2. Analyse
3. Define
4. Prototype
5. Test

---

Be prepared to repeat the **Define**, **Prototype** and **Test** phases until you have a prototype that your users are happy with.

---

(Although in our case, we are constrained by the course timetable, so we won't have time to redefine)
