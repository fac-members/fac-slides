The Design Sprint as most people understand it comes from the [Google Ventures Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/).

---

The Google Ventures team defines a design sprint as a 5-day process having 5 phases: _Understand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype, Test_.

---

We are not going to follow the Google Ventures sprint precisely. We are going to treat the design sprint as a 4-step process.

---

1. Discover
2. Define
3. Prototype
4. Test

---

## 1. Discover

---

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Whose needs are you trying to address?
- What is your understanding of their needs?
- Are your assumptions about their needs correct?
- What are your measures of success in meeting those needs?

---

### Primary activities

- Qualitative user research

  - Interviews

- Quantitative user research
  - e.g. collective expressions of interest via a prominent link on your website home page to a sign up page

---

### Primary outputs

- Problem statement
- Research data

---

## 2. Define

---

- How might we meet the user need?
- Is the proposed product or service feasible to build? (i.e. is it within the competence of your team)
- Is it a viable idea for your organisation? (i.e. does the potential value to users justify the cost of development?)
- What might be the unintended consequences of this approach? ("consequence scanning")
- What data do we need to collect or content do we need to create before we can proceed with this approach?

---

### Primary activities

- Resource planning
- Storyboarding
- Data collection and content creation

---

### Primary outputs

- Initial commitment of time and resources
- Low-fidelity prototypes
- Initial catalogue of content and data

---

## 3. Prototype

---

- What might the solution look like?

---

### Primary activities

- Prototyping
- One-on-one stakeholder acceptance

---

### Primary output

- A high-fidelity prototype

---

## 4. Test

---

What do users think of it?

---

### Primary activity

- Qualitative user testing

---

### Primary output

- A validated prototype

---

## Recap

1. Discover
1. Define
1. Prototype
1. Test

---

Be prepared to repeat the **Define**, **Prototype** and **Test** phases until you have a prototype that your users are happy with.

---

(Although in our case, we are constrained by the course timetable, so scope for significant product redefinition after the end of this week will be limited.)
