# Usability Testing

---

Getting feedback from real people in order to inform the decisions we make when designing and building a digital product

---

### Why test?

- Get feedback quickly
- See how someone unfamiliar with the idea interacts with a app
- Understand which features to prioritise
- Adapt the content and copy

---

### How to test?

- Go to your users & put your app in their hands
- Encourage honesty & thinking out loud
- Focus on journeys or tasks
- Record the findings

---

### Avoid

- Over explaining the idea
- Showing them the journey rather than letting them explore
- Filling the silence

---

### Testing online

- Share the link to your prototype
- Ask your user to share their screen
- Observe and listen

---

### Start with an introduction

> Thanks for helping us today. My name is Belinda, I’m a developer. The app we're working on is...

---

### Explain the process

---

We’re testing the app, not you, you don’t need to worry about making mistakes

---

Be honest, you’re not going to hurt our feelings and any negative feedback helps us improve the idea

---

Ask any questions you have throughout but I might not answer them until the end

---

We’ll be recording the screen/taking notes...

---

## Asking questions

---

Start with general questions:

- How do you feel about shopping online? Do you do it often?
- How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the internet?

---

## Tasks

---

Giving your user some tasks to complete can help you to see how they use your app

---

For example:

- Could you create a profile?
- Where might you look for help?
- How would you book an appointment?

---

## Closing off

---

Ask a few questions to wrap up the session:

- How was your overall experience moving around the app?
- What else would you like it to do?
- Anything else you feel we should know?
