## Glossary

---

### Agile software development

The iterative approach to software development

---

### Scrum(TM)

A widely-used and agile software development method, that introduces the following terms

---

### Sprint

A fixed period of development time during which the team will not respond to new change requests

---

#### Sprint length

Two weeks is typical, but each week we are going to do a single two-day sprint. For your final projects, you will be doing one-week sprints.

---

### User story

An action that a user wants to perform

---

### User story

_"As a...
I want...
So that..."_

---

### Backlog

All uncompleted user stories

---

### Sprint retrospective

Stop, go, continue

---

### [Project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)

_"Kanban"_
which you are going to use to track your project

---

### Kanban columns

- `backlog`
- `doing`
- `done`

---

### RECAP

- Scrum(TM)
- Sprint
- User story
- Backlog
- Sprint retrospective
- Project board (_Kanban_)

---

## Team roles

---

### 1. User Experience

Championing the user stories to ensure that your product meets the users' needs.

---

### 2. Deployment (DevOps)

Project set up, file architecture, third party tools, keeping secrets secret.

---

### 3. Quality Assurance (QA)

Clear variable names, simple and concise code, adequate test coverage.

---

### 4. Facilitation (Scrum Facilitator)

Ensuring a smooth process and good communication.

---

Consider taking on the role that you feel least comfortable with

Take each role once, over the next six weeks

---

1. User Experience
2. Deployment
3. Quality
4. Facilitation

---

## The ~~daily~~ standup

---

Punctuate your build with check-ins amongst the team

---

Focus on three things:

- What have you done?
- What will you do next?
- Is there anything blocking progress?

---

The Facilitator leads stand-up and gives everyone an opportunity to speak

It is the responsibility of the Facilitator to manage resolving blockers

---

### Remember...

- Actually stand up
- Take no more than 10 minutes
- Facilitator can
  - take notes of actions e.g. project board updates
  - take notes of blockers to address
  - motivate the team

---

Swap pairs in your teams frequently

Everyone should pair with everyone else

---

When you swap, punctuate the switch with a stand-up

---

## Presentations

- Show your project board
- Identify your roles and the challenges of the role
- Let us know how you worked together

---

On Thursdays, you'll have time for role circles

This is a chance for cross-team collaboration grouped around your roles

---

## The Agile Manifesto

---

A number of approaches to Software Development are rooted in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

---

The agile manifesto was written in 2001 by a group of 17 software developers who had met to discuss the future of software development

---

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Do companies follow this process?

---

Not always...

---

A FAC alumn, and experienced software developer, told of the approach their former employer took to software development. Something we might call...

---

_Shovelling ðŸ’© onto the development team_

---

## Extreme Programming

another agile approach to software development

---

_Extreme Programming improves a software project in five essential ways; communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage._

---

## Final thoughts

---

There are many different approaches to developing software, and most companies won't rigidly follow one in particular

---

Being aware of the approaches, and how your company operates is an important part of meeting the apprenticeship standard
