## The ~~daily~~ standup

---

Punctuate your build with check-ins amongst the team.

---

Focus on three things:

- What have you completed?
- What will you do next?
- Is there anything blocking progress?

---

The Facilitator leads stand-up and gives everyone an opportunity to speak

It is the responsibility of the Facilitator to manage resolving blockers

---

### Remember...

- Actually stand up
- Take no more than 15 minutes
- Facilitator can
  - take notes of actions e.g. project board updates
  - take notes of blockers to address
  - motivate the team

---

Swap pairs in your teams frequently

A team of three can have an individual flying solo for some parts of the day

Everyone should pair with everyone else

---

When you swap, punctuate the switch with a stand-up

---

## Presentations

- Show your project board
- Identify your roles and the challenges of the role
- Let us know how you worked together

---

From next week onwards, you'll have time for role circles

This is a chance for cross-team collaboration grouped around your roles

---

### That's all for now
