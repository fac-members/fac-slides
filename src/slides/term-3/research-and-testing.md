# User Research and Usability Testing

---

Validating an idea with a user group is an important part of software development

---

During design week, you'll conduct User Research after you've completed the Discovery Workshop

---

Feedback from your users will be analysed and inform the direction of the Product

---

After the Definition Workshop, you'll create a clickable prototype using Figma

---

This prototype will be tested with users in Usability Testing sessions

---

## Scheduling

---

User Research will be completed in a 2-hour window on Monday

Usability Testing will be completed in a 2-hour window on Wednesday

---

You'll conduct 20-30 minute research / testing sessions in pairs

---

Each person in the team should arrange for 2 users to be available during each of the 2-hour windows.

The team will complete research with 8 people and complete testing with 8 people

---

Schedule your users for time slots, in 30 minute intervals

---

| Time  | Pair 1 | Pair 2 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 14:00 | User 1 | User 2 |
| 14:30 | User 3 | User 4 |
| 15:00 | User 5 | User 6 |
| 15:30 | User 7 | User 8 |
| 16:00 | End    | End    |

---

You can ask the same people to be available for both sessions, or have different users for the separate windows

---

Find users who are not familiar with the Product idea, but they might be people who would fit into the target user group

---

Try to avoid conducting research and testing with developers, who will be aware of what happens behind the scenes

### Suggested messaging

I‚Äôm looking for volunteers for a 20-30 minute User Research session for my final project at Founders and Coders.

We‚Äôll have a list of questions ahead of time to facilitate discussion. No technical experience is required, this session is intended to gather feedback on our app idea and challenge our assumptions!

Would you be available anytime between 2pm and 4pm on Monday?

You do not have to have technical experience, we‚Äôre looking to understand how people use our Product, from your point of view.

We will need to watch you interacting with a working mockup of our app, you'll share your screen while you talk out loud, so please join on your laptop!
