# Discovery Workshop

---

The Discovery workshop helps examine our understanding of the user and the problem(s) they are facing

---

Our key activities:

- Defining a problem statement
- Creating user personas
- Writing a user research script

---

## Problem statements

- Who is our user?
- What is their need?
- How will responding to that need benefit them?

---

## User Personas

Fictional representations of our user group and the diversity within it

---

## Research scripting

A guide for questions to ask during a user interview. This gives structure to the interview - going off script is encouraged

---

## User Research

---

User interviews, using a script as a guide

---

Ask open-ended questions and welcome critical feedback

---

Avoid confirming biases, instead validated or refute them

---

Give the user space to speak and give feedback
