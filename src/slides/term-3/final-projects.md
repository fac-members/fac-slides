# Introduction to Final Projects

---

In the second half of the programme, you'll work on two long form projects

---

1. In-house project
1. Tech for Better project

---

Each project will be 3 weeks long and composed of:

- One design sprint
- Two build sprints

---

There is no prescribed tech stack. Your teams will make decisions on what technologies to use to solve the problem.

---

## In-house Project

---

Each person in the cohort will come up with an idea for a project.

Each team will choose one project idea to work on.

---

A chance to learn new technologies and see how a larger project fits together.

An opportunity to practise working on a larger project before Tech for Better.

### User research and usability testing

You'll be conducting user research and usability testing with real people during Design Week.

We'll ask each person to schedule for a few users to be available during Design Week.

More on this in week six...

## Tech for Better

---

Over the next few weeks, you'll be delving deeper into project ideas with Product Owners

---

Consider which project you'd like to work on for your final project

---

- What will be an interesting challenge to work on?
- What will expand your technical skills?
- Is the scope reasonable for 2 weeks of building?
- Could you hold a working relationship with that Product Owner?

---

You will choose your projects in Week 8, the first In-house Design Sprint.
