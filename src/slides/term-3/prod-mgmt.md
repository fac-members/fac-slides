#### Inconvenient truths about product development

- Most product ideas won't work
- Those that might work will take several iterations to get right

---

Central to the product development process is the role of **_product manager_**.

## The product manager

---

_"The CEO of the product"_

---

The key to their role is holding the vision of the Product and ensure that the team is able to make progress towards that vision.

Their task is to spot ideas that won't work early in the process, reduce the risk of failure, and make sure the organisation is learning at every stage of development.
