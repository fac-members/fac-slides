## Cohort Expectations

---

Alongside our code of conduct, we'd like you to reflect on what you expect of one another throughout the programme

---

Think about how you'd like to interact with one another to form a safe, welcoming and cohesive space for learning

---

Consider:

- What will help you learn most?
- What might prevent you from learning?
- What will make you feel comfortable, included, and able to give your best?
- What would your ideal learning environment feel like?

---

We'll start in small groups, of 3 or 4, coming up with a list of mutual expectations

_15 minutes_

---

We'll then discuss as a cohort what you'd like to commit to as a group

_30 minutes_

---

Let's go!
