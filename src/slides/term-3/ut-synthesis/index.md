# Usability Testing Synthesis

---

There are two main avenues to analysing results from testing:

- Qualitative
- Quantitative

---

Qualitative synthesis is looking at the things that were said and organising them into broad categories

---

This is the more common way to analyse results, and can be done in a similar way as you did with your user research

---

Quantitative analyses is measuring how much things were said, or done

---

There are two methods we'll look at:

- Traffic Light analysis
- Rainbow charts

---

## Traffic Light Analysis

---

Create a spreadsheet or table with tasks you asked the users to complete as rows; and participants as columns

---

Mark whether the user:

- Completed the task
- Struggled with the task
- Did not complete the task

---

## Rainbow Charts

---

On a spreadsheet, list observations in rows, and participants in columns. Where an observation occurs, mark the cell, giving each participant a different colour.
