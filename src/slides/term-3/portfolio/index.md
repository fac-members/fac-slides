# Portfolio

---

To complete your apprenticeship, you'll be assessed in two ways:

- Project (“Work-based project with questioning”)
- Portfolio (“Professional discussion underpinned by portfolio”)

---

When you enter EPA gateway you must submit:

- a 500-word project summary
- your portfolio
- Evidence of Level 2 English
- Evidence of Level 2 Maths
- Sign-off from your employer

So you should only start assessment when these are ready.

---

Founders and Coders will support you throughout the lead up and during EPA gateway

---

Each term, Gregor is available for regular check-ins and portfolio feedback

We'll also hold 'tripartite reviews' between you, your employer, and us

## Portfolio

---

**Your portfolio is not directly assessed**.

It is used as the basis for the "professional discussion", which determines 50% of your grade.

---

The portfolio 'typically' contains 10 pieces of evidence

---

Each should relate to at least one of the required knowledge, skills or behaviours. And most likely, they'll cover many.

---

There is no specific structure for the documentation

---

Evidence is documentation which:

1. Summarises each of your work projects
1. Describes all the ways **you** met the required knowledge, skills & behaviours
1. Includes code samples, screenshots of plans/issues/stories, architecture diagrams etc

---

Build your portfolio throughout your apprenticeship

---

Focus on **WHAT** you did and **HOW** you did it.

**WHO** is important too - but your assessor will be looking to hear what **you** did, so always use **I, me, my** and avoid **we, us, our**.

Also consider, **WHY** you are making the technical decisions that you are.

---

- WHAT
- HOW
- WITH WHOM
- WHY

---

Put together a narrative of what you did on the project, and use supporting evidence.

Mapping to KSBs comes after documenting, and in a separate document.

---

## Mapping

---

Put together a separate document with a table which maps your evidence to the KSBs
