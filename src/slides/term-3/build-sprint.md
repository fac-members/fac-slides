## Glossary

---

### RECAP

---

### Scrum(TM)

A widely-used software development method, typified by the use of _Sprints_ and the roles of _Product Owner_ and _Scrum Facilitator_.

---

### Sprint

A fixed period of development time during which the team will not respond to new change requests. Two weeks is typical, but we will be doing one-week sprints.

---

### User story

An action that a user wants to perform

_"As a...
I want...
So that..."_

---

### Product backlog

All uncompleted user stories

---

### Estimate

The difficulty level of a user story, expressed in _points_

---

### Velocity

The team capacity, expressed in points, for each sprint

---

### Sprint backlog

A prioritised backlog of all the user stories that we estimate will be completed in the next sprint, given each user story estimate and the team's velocity

---

### Sprint planning

Where the team reprioritises user stories and agrees the next sprint backlog

---

### Sprint review

Where the team compares their points estimate of each user story with their actual points and adjusts their estimated velocity for the next sprint

---

### Sprint retrospective

Stop, go, continue

---

### Some new terms

---

### Daily stand-up

Three-item agenda

1. What have you done since the last stand-up?
2. What are you working on next?
3. What is blocking your work?

---

### Scrum Facilitator

The person responsible for ensuring that the product team is effectively following Scrum practice (including _stand-ups_).

---

### Product Owner

The sole person responsible for managing the product backlog.

---

#### Note

The **_Product Owner_**, a term specific to Scrum, is only part of the competence of a good **_Product Manager_**, a wider role that encompasses determining the strategic direction of a new product, not just its delivery.

On longer projects, 3-4 _sprints_ might be wrapped in a _release_.

---

The release cycle gives an opportunity to iteratively review progress, resourcing and budget against business expectations.

---

## Release

2. Budget
3. 3-4 Sprints
4. Review of progress vs business need

---

## In conclusion

---

At the start of the build, set time aside to prioritise and label your user stories, estimate your velocity and set your sprint goals.

---

At the end of each sprint (on Fridays), complete a sprint review, retrospective, and plan for the next sprint.

---

At the end of the final sprint, make sure you complete your handover documentation.

---

And don't forget the daily stand-up.
