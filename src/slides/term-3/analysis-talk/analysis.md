# Analysis Workshop

---

From the Discovery workshop and user research, we should now have a validated idea of the problem ...

---

Or enough feedback from users to know we’re not on the right track

---

In this session your teams will collate and explore what you found out during your user research

---

## Research Synthesis

---

Like to your TfB anaysis session, you'll complete these steps:

1. Write notes on what came out of the research
1. Theme those notes
1. Write insight statements to summarise the notes

---

### Writing notes

Each pair will summarise their research and add notes to Miro under specific headings

---

### Theming notes

As a team, think of themes to summarise the findings of your combined research

---

### Insights

Looking at the themes, ask 'What does this mean?'

Summarise the themes with statements analysing their content

---

## Mapping the Journey

---

Plan the main path through the application, considering 3 areas:

- Discovery: how will users find your service
- Learning: how will users find out what the service offers and how to use it
- Using: what are the regular steps the user will take when using the app

---

Discovery is the least important step for us on the programme. It’s worth considering but not for more than a minute or two.

---

## How Might We?

---

Think about the key challenges of building a Product which will respond to the user needs identified

---

Ask questions, not worrying about finding all the answers now. For example:

- What technical challenges will there be?
- How will we manage data?
- What do we not know how to achieve?
