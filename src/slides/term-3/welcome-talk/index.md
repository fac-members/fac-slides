## Safeguarding

---

**Safeguarding** means protecting children, young people and adults at risk from abuse and neglect.

---

**Prevent** is a government policy intended to safeguard people and communities from the threat of terrorism.

---

Safeguarding is about being vigilant.

If you see or hear anything that concerns you while studying here please use our reporting form to tell us about it.

---

Doing so will allow us to build up a case file of reported incidents that will help us be better prepared to identify and respond to potential issues in future.

---

Our safeguarding team is:

- **Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Dan Sofer
- **Deputy Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Gregor Thomson

---

Our reporting form is here:

## Cohort expectations

---

Alongside the official code of conduct, we'd like you to think about what you expect from one another throughout the course. How can you each contribute to a supportive and welcoming learning environment? What do you expect from one another?

---

In groups of 4, write up a list of expecations in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io)

---

As a cohort, take turns in your groups suggesting points to add to a cohort expectations document

---

Amend the document and agree to uphold it
