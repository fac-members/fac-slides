**Safeguarding** means protecting children, young people and adults at risk from abuse and neglect.

Safeguarding is about being vigilant.

If you see or hear anything that concerns you while studying here please use our reporting form to tell us about it.

---

Doing so will allow us to build up a case file of reported incidents that will help us be better prepared to identify and respond to potential issues in future.

Our safeguarding team is:

- **Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Dan Sofer
- **Deputy Designated Safeguarding Officer**: Gregor Thomson
