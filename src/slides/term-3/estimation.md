# Issue management and estimation

---

Good development is dependent on effective project management.

This session will introduce new concepts essencial to your project planning and management.

## Are you familiar with all of the following concepts?

---

- Scrum(TM)
- Sprint
- User story
- Backlog
- Sprint retrospective
- Project board (*Kanban*)

---

### Here are some new concepts

(can you guess at their meaning?)

---

## Estimate

---
### Meaning:
*The difficulty level of an issue*

---

Estimates are expressed in points and represented with an **E** 

For example: **E2** meaning, an issue estimated to be a 2 in difficulty

---

Some people prefer to estimate in _absolute_ time, expressed in hours or half-days, but in order to develop a good sense of _relative_ time, for now we will estimate our user stories in _points_

---

### Velocity

The team capacity, expressed in points, for each sprint

---

### Sprint backlog

A prioritised backlog of all the user stories that we estimate will be completed in the next sprint

---

### Sprint planning

Where the team reprioritises user stories and agrees the next sprint backlog

---

### Sprint review

Where the team compares their estimate with the actual number of user stories completed

---

### RECAP

- Estimate
- Velocity
- Sprint backlog
- Sprint planning and review

---

### Note

Not all issues raised in the project board contribute to the velocity estimate. **Chores**, **bugs**, **refactors** and **spikes** are all zero-point issues, even though they will (seriously) impact your sprint velocity.

---

### Zero-point issues

- **Chore** Something that needs to be done, not directly related to a user story
- **Bug** Something broken
- **Refactor** An improvement to the code that delivers no change to user experience
- **Spike** Researching a potential solution to a problem by creating the simplest possible implementation of it

---

## Labels

To be added to issues

---

### Estimates

- `E1` - Short story, estimated
- `E2` - Story, estimated
- `E3` - Long story, estimated
- `E5` - Extra long story, estimated

---

### Actuals

- `A1` - Short story, actual
- `A2` - Story, actual
- `A3` - Long story, actual
- `A5` - Extra long story, actual

---

### Issue types

- `story`
- `chore`
- `bug`
- `refactor`
- `spike`

---

## After code review

Label all issues correctly before addressing them

---

## Presentations

- Report on estimated vs actual velocity
- And don't forget to show your project board

---

### Final thought: Hofstadter's Law

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
