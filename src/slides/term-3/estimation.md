# Issue management and estimation

---

1. [A quick intro to managing software projects](../proj-mgmt)
2. [Issue management and estimation](../estimation)
3. [The Design Sprint](../design-sprint)
4. [The Build Sprint](../build-sprint)
5. [Product Management and the Product Owner role](../prod-mgmt)

---

Estimation is probably the most valuable skill you need to cultivate as a developer.

## Glossary

---

### RECAP

- Scrum(TM)
- Sprint
- User story
- Backlog, sprint backlog
- Sprint planning, retrospective and review
- Project board (_Kanban_)

---

### Some new definitions

---

### Estimate

The difficulty level of a user story, expressed in _points_

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate in _absolute_ time, expressed in hours or half-days, but in order to develop a good sense of _relative_ time, for now we will estimate our user stories in _points_

---

### Velocity

The team capacity, expressed in points, for each sprint

---

### Sprint backlog

_new definition_
A prioritised backlog of all the user stories that we estimate will be completed in the next sprint, _given each user story estimate and the team's velocity_

---

### Sprint review

_new definition_
Where the team compares their _points estimate of each user story with their actual points and adjusts their estimated velocity for the next sprint_

---

### RECAP

- Scrum(TM)
- Sprint
- User story
- Estimate _NEW_
- Velocity _NEW_
- Backlog, sprint backlog
- Sprint planning, retrospective and review
- Project board (_Kanban_)

---

### Note

Not all issues raised in the project board contribute to the velocity estimate. **Chores**, **bugs**, **refactors** and **spikes** are all zero-point issues, even though they will (seriously) impact your sprint velocity.

---

### Zero-point issues

- **Chore** Something that needs to be done, not directly related to a user story
- **Bug** Something broken
- **Refactor** An improvement to the code that delivers no change to user experience
- **Spike** Researching a potential solution to a problem by creating the simplest possible implementation of it

---

#### CONTROVERSY ALERT

Some people prefer to estimate chores, bugs, refactors and spikes just like user stories. The argument for making them zero-point issues is to emphasise that they are _non-negotiable_ and therefore outside the scope of the sprint planning process.

## Labels

To be added to issues

---

### Kanban

- `backlog`
- `stretch`
- `todo`
- `doing`
- `done`

---

### New labels

---

### Estimates

- `E1` - Short story, estimated
- `E2` - Story, estimated
- `E3` - Long story, estimated
- `E5` - Extra long story, estimated

---

### Actuals

- `A1` - Short story, actual
- `A2` - Story, actual
- `A3` - Long story, actual
- `A5` - Extra long story, actual

---

### Issue types

- `story`
- `chore`
- `bug`
- `refactor`
- `spike`

---

## After code review

Label all issues correctly before addressing them

---

## Presentations

- Report on estimated vs actual velocity
- And don't forget to show your project board

### Final thought: Hofstadter's Law

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
