<!-- {.primary} -->

## Our values

---

### Cooperative

We expect you to prioritise collective learning over personal goals.

---

### Inclusive

We want the tech industry to be a place where people from all backgrounds can thrive.

---

### Social Impact

We provide digital solutions to non-profits through our Tech for Better programme.

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## What kind of people are we looking for?

---

We prioritise a cohesive cohort of people who we think will work well together over any strong individual candidates.

---

Learning to code is just _part_ of what makes you a good developer.

---

The tech industry is disproportionately white, male and university-educated.

---

Founders and Coders will always prioritise marginalised people’s safety over the comfort of the privileged.

---

### Applying stage

## Apprentices vs. non-apprentices

---

### The main difference

- Being an apprentice is less financially risky than looking for work _after_ completing training

---

### The similarities

- An employer looks for the same qualities and has broadly similar expectations of both
- Salaries after the end of the apprenticeship (typically 12-15 months) are likely to be similar

---

### Income differences

- An apprentice earns £24,000 in their first year  
  (since you start earning from Week 1)
- In the same time period a non-apprentice graduate is likely to earn between £10,000 and £20,000  
  (since you won't start earning until well after you graduate)

---

### Contract differences

- The contract ends when the apprenticeship ends
- After which a new contract (at a significantly higher salary) can be signed
