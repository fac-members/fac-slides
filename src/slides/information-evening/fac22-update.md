## Apprentices vs. non-apprentices 

---  

### The main difference 

- Being an apprentice is less financially risky than looking for work _after_ completing training

---  

### The similarities 
- An employer looks for the same qualities and has broadly similar expectations of both
- Salaries after the end of the apprenticeship (typically 15 months) are likely to be similar

---  

### Income differences

- An apprentice earns £24,000 in their first year, at the same time that a non-apprentice graduate of our training is likely to earn between £10,000 and £20,000.
---

### Contract differences

- The contract ends when the apprenticeship ends (18 months from September)  
- After which a new contract (at a significantly higher salary) can be signed 

---

## We anticipated some questions

---

### What if I have not secured an apprenticeship by September?

---

### Am I guaranteed an apprenticeship if I want one?

--- 

### Can I turn down an apprenticeship offer? 

--- 

### What about the Tech for Better programme?
