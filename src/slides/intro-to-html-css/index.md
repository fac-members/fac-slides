Before completing your tribute page, complete:

## The Tribute Page

---

The first project to complete in our pre-application stage is to build a small website in CodePen (https://codepen.io/) using HTML and CSS

---

This site can be about something you like or about someone (public figure) you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal.

---

This will give you the opportunity to practice with HTML and CSS as well as demonstrate your learnings from this stage

---

1. The page has a title, or heading, at the top of the page
2. There are at least three images on the page
3. Elements have styles such as background colours, borders, margins and padding
4. Some pieces of text have emphasis such as bold or italics
5. A user can click on a link that takes them to another website
6. The page has at least one list
7. Everything on the page fits on any screen size, without content overflowing or being cut off
