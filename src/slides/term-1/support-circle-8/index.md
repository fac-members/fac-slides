Week 8 - Interviewing

---

<!-- {.secondary inverted}-->

## Interviewing w/ FAC

---

Today, we'll talk about what the interview for FAC is like

---

None of us here are on the interview panel, and won't be making decisions on who gets onto the programme

---

We want to give you the chance to practice for an interview

---

The FAC interview has three parts:

1. Conversational
1. Demonstration of learning
1. Code read

---

## Conversational

---

Tell the interview panel about yourself, and why you want to be a developer

---

## Demonstration of learning

---

Answer questions about what you've learnt throughout the application process

---

You'll be asked questions related to [this set of learnings](https://foundersandcoders.notion.site/Application-Learnings-46255bc6c5584c7ba44cf5f125133ad4)

---

## Code read

---

Look at some code which you haven't written and talk about what it does

---

You'll be given a GitHub repository and some instructions
