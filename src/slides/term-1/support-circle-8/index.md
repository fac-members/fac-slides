## Interviewing w/ FAC

---

Today, we'll talk about what the interview for FAC is like

---

None of us here are on the interview panel, and won't be making decisions on who gets onto the programme

---

We want to give you the chance to practice for an interview

---

The FAC interview has three parts:

1. Conversational
1. Demonstration of learning
1. Code read

---

## Conversational

---

Tell the interview panel about yourself, and why you want to be a developer

---

## Demonstration of learning
