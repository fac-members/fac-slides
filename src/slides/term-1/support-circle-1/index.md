## Approaching problems

A four-step approach

---

### 1. Understand the problem

What is it asking you to do? What are the inputs and outputs?

---

### 2. Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps

Use JavaScript Comments

---

### 3. Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Remember to `console.log()` to check your code along the way.

---

### 4. Refactor

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?
