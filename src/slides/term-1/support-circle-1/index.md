<!-- {.secondary .inverted} -->

## Say hello

---

### Introduce yourself

- Let everyone know your name and pronouns (if you're comfortable with sharing them)
- Let us know what you're working on just now
- What is one thing you'd like to get from this group?
- What is one thing you can give to the group?

---

## Applying to FAC

---

Start by creating an account

https://account.foundersandcoders.com/

---

Work through the projects in your own time

---

If you're brand new to coding, check out [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

---

FAC have a Discord community and coding meetups every Tuesday evening

---

Before the application deadline, you'll need to complete the application form

---

We're gonna focus on one project each week

_BUT_

we don't expect you to be completing one project per week

---

Take each one as an introduction, and move at your own pace

Learning to code is a marathon not a sprint
üíõ

---

### Upcoming application deadlines

- Sunday 26 March for the cohort starting 11 May
- Sunday 23 July for the cohort starting 14 September

---

We're here to give you support, and we encourage you to work together

---

## Approaching problems

A four-step approach

---

### 1. Understand the problem

What is it asking you to do? What are the inputs and outputs?

---

### 2. Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps

Use JavaScript Comments

---

### 3. Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Remember to `console.log()` to check your code along the way

---

### 4. Refactor

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?

---

## Pair Programming

---

Pair programming is working together on a problem or feature

---

When pairing, it‚Äôs important for both developers to feel comfortable and able to contribute

---

There are a thousand ways to work together

Figure out what works for you, and communicate with your partner about that to find a balance

---

### Methods

---

**Ping pong** üèì

Take turns writing code. Maybe, one developer writes a line of code and then the other writes a line of code. In a longer session, you might extend this, perhaps by writing for 10 minutes and then swapping who is ‚Äòdriving‚Äô.

---

**Backseat Driver** üöï

One developer types and follows the instructions of the other developer. The person ‚Äòdriving‚Äô is the one typing and should follow exactly the instructions of the ‚Äònavigator‚Äô. If the navigator is lost and would like a suggestion, they can ask the driver where they think to go next or suggest somewhere to look online for a solution.

---

It‚Äôs important to switch roles, and for both people to be coding. You get more out of it by getting stuck in.

---

Switch regularly and give the other person time to read through the code base before they take over. Being able to talk though someone else‚Äôs code is a skill and will enhance your understanding.

## Intro to Git & GitHub

---

## Git

---

Git saves the history of changes you make to a project

---

Saves "snapshots" of your project with descriptive messages

---

This means you can go back to previous versions of a project

---

Git can be used from VS Code, or via the terminal

---

## GitHub

---

GitHub is a website for storing code

---

Storing code on GitHub means you can download it to any device and you have a back-up

---
