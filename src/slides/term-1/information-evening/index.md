## Our values

---

### Cooperative

We expect you to prioritise collective learning over personal goals.

---

### Inclusive

We want the tech industry to be a place where people from all backgrounds can thrive.

---

### Social Impact

We provide digital solutions to non-profits through our Tech for Better programme.

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## What kind of people are we looking for?

---

We prioritise a cohesive cohort of people who we think will work well together over any strong individual candidates.

---

Learning to code is just _part_ of what makes you a good developer.

---

The tech industry is disproportionately white, male and university-educated.

---

Founders and Coders will always prioritise marginalised people’s safety over the comfort of the privileged.

## Important changes this time

---

### 1. Right now the job market is tough, _however_

Even though 2020 has been challenging, everyone on our most recent cohort has found a job as junior developer between 2-4 months after graduation

---

### 2. We are now an apprenticeship training provider

We will be offering 16 places on our Autumn 2021 programme. We do not yet know how many of those 16 will be able to secure an apprenticeship.

---

### 3. Apprentice interviews will happen in the summer

For successful applicants to our programme, apprenticeship interviews with employers are likely to be in July/August. Those who are successfull will start the full-time programme as apprentices in September.

---

### 4. Apprentices and non-apprentices will study together

Although the apprentice programme may be only 12 weeks long. Other students will have the option to continue for longer through Tech for Better.

---

### 5. Apprentice vs Entry-level pay

Typical entry-level salaries are around £30,000. Our apprentice salaries are probably going to be £24,000. Taking into account the 3 months of paid study, that works out about the same. As well as being paid while you study, there may be a benefit in having the job interview stress before you start the programme instead of after you finish.
