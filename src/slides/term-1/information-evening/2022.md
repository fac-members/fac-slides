### Things these slides cover

- Founders and Coders
- Our programmes
- Applications

---

Founders and Coders is not your ordinary coding bootcamp. We’re on a mission to prove that for many people peer-led learning is the most effective and least expensive route into the tech industry.

---

### What we do

- **Skills Bootcamp:** Attend the best, tuition-free web development bootcamp in London.
- **Apprenticeship training:** Learn back-end development and train with a company.

---

### Skills Bootcamp

A 12-week part-time programme where you'll learn front-end web development and interview with apprenticeship employers.

---

The Skills Bootcamp requires a commitment of two evenings and an additional 10+ hours of self-study, homework, and projects per week. Due to the pandemic, the course is currently virtual.

---

### Apprenticeship training

A full-time programme for 12-weeks, mentored by the previous apprenticeship cohort. You'll learn Node, SQL, Express, React, and Next.js.

---

Completing the part-time Skills Bootcamp does not guarantee an apprenticeship

To be eligible for the Apprenticeship training, you must complete the Skills Bootcamp

---

After your training, you'll join your employer. You'll work with them for 12 months before starting End-Point Assessment

---

End-point assessment is your opportunity to prove your skills and receive a Level-4 Software Development Apprenticeship qualification.

---

- Be 18 years old or older
- Be eligible to apply for an apprenticeship

### Meetups

We organise our meetups on Discord.

Our current cohort members mentor the meetups and support you while you work with other applicants.

---

Our meetups are the closest learning environment to our full-time programme we can offer to the applicants community.

You'd rarely work alone on our programmes so take this as an opportunity to see if group and project-based learning is suitable for you before you decide to apply.

---

We're changing the criteria for running our meetups. We will only run the meetup if:

- We have at least 15 people attending
- More than half of sign-ups are from people who are women or non-binary

> What can we do to give ourselves the best possible chance of getting a job/ launching our tech careers? After completing the course, will we be employable in the current job market?
