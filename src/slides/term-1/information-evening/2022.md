## Application stages

---

Learning to code requires study, practice, and problem solving. What it shouldn’t require is a lot of money. We don’t charge people one penny to learn how to code. The only barrier to entry for the tech industry should be a curious mind.

---

Your application is for our DfE funded Skills Bootcamp.

### 2. Join us on Discord

If you’re eligible, we’ll send you an invite to Founders and Coders’ community on Discord.

Plus, it's where we have our virtual classrooms so it's good to get familiar with it early!
