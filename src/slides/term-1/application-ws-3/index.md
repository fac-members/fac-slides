# Application workshops

## 3. Solving Challenges

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## Before we start...

---

We are removing the Codewars part of our course requirements

Completing the kata will no longer be required to apply to our course

---

### Why?

We've found that focusing on Codewars can be a distraction from learning how websites fit together

Also, the Codewars community can be hostile

---

We'll be replacing this portion of the requirements with our weekly prompts

---

We'd like everyone in the community to solve every weekly prompt - in your own time

These will give you the opportunity to learn web development in a practical way

---

From week 5 onwards, we'll ask everyone to upload their solutions to GitHub

We'll introduce how to do this in that week

For now, keep your solutions on Repl or your own computer

---

You'll have a record of your own learning as you've progressed through the application cycle

ðŸŒ±

---

We'll ask everyone to share their profile with us at FAC

We will review them all towards the end of the application cycle to get a general sense of your progress

---

Bearing that in mind, you may still find Codewars useful as a platform to practice solving problems

---

## Approaching problems

A four-step approach

---

### 1. Understand the problem

What is it asking you to do? What are the inputs and outputs?

---

### 2. Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps

Use JavaScript Comments

---

### 3. Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Remember to `console.log()` to check your code along the way.

---

### 4. Refactor

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## Tips

---

Use `console.log()` often

---

Re-read the problem

---

Check your inputs and outputs

---

Check for syntax errors

---

Read any error messages

---

## Challenges

---

We'll follow these steps:

1. Present a challenge
1. Take time to reflect and understand
1. I'll ask for pseudocode solutions
1. We'll write some JavaScript
1. We'll consider ways to refactor the code

---

### Squaring a number

Write a function which accepts one input, a number.

The function should return the square of that number.

---

### Odd or Even

Write a function which accepts a number as an argument.

The function should determine whether the number is even or odd.

Return 'Even' or 'Odd' based on the parity of the number.

---

### Sum of positive

Write a function which accepts an array as an argument.

The function should add up all the positive numbers from the array and return the sum.

If there are no positive numbers to sum, return zero.
