## Using Git in the terminal

---

So far, you'll have been using Git in VS Code

---

The terminal is that black box on your computer that makes you look like a hacker

---

It's sometimes known as the command line

---

It allows us to type commands, create documents, and move around files in a computer

---

We can install Git in the terminal

---

This allows us to stage, commit and push files to GitHub directly

---

### Why bother?

---

It's pretty common as a developer to use the command line rather than a GUI (Graphical User Interface)

---

Once you're familiar with it, it's faster than using Finder or Windows Explorer to create and move files
