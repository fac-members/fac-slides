## Say hello

---

### Introduce yourself

- Let everyone know your name and pronouns (if you're comfortable with sharing them)

## HTML

üß±

---

HTML is the language we use to create the structure of a webpage

---

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

---

In HTML, we use different tags wrapped around content to build webpages

```html
<h1>Main heading</h1>
<p>Paragraph text</p>
```

---

## CSS

üé®

---

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document

---

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

---

In CSS, we write selectors which target HTML elements and CSS properties to define how these elements should look

---

We define rules, for particular elements:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

---

## JavaScript

ü§ñ

---

JavaScript is a coding language which allows us to write complicated functionality for our websites

---

For example, adding numbers together or calculating how long a `string` is

---

```js
const num1 = 2;
const num2 = 5;

let result = num1 + num2;
```

---

## DOM

---

DOM stands for the Document Object Model

---

This is a representation of an HTML webpage in JavaScript

---

Manipulating the DOM allows us to add complex functionality to a site

---

For example, when a user clicks a button then the background colour changes

---

## An analogy

## Approaching problems

A four-step approach

---

### 1. Understand the problem

What is it asking you to do? What are the inputs and outputs?

---

### 2. Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps

Use JavaScript Comments

---

### 3. Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Remember to `console.log()` to check your code along the way.

---

### 4. Refactor

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?
