## HTML

HTML is the language we use to create the structure of a webpage

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

In HTML, we use different tags wrapped around content to build webpages

---

## CSS

üé®

---

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document

---

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

---

In CSS, we write selectors which target HTML elements and CSS properties to define how these elements should look

---

## JavaScript

ü§ñ

---

JavaScript is a coding language which allows us to write complicated functionality for our websites

---

For example, adding numbers together or calculating how long a `string` is

---

## DOM

DOM stands for the Document Object Model

This is a representation of an HTML webpage in JavaScript

Manipulating the DOM allows us to add complex functionality to a site
