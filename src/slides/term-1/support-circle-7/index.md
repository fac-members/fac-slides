## Game

---

The requirements for this project are more open ended than the others

---

Build a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is open-ended and a chance for you to explore creating something with different complex parts that interact with each other.

---

### Examples

---

**Tic Tac Toe**
Two players compete to get a line of noughts or crosses in a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place a piece and the game ends when either player has three in a row, column, or diagonal. A draw occurs if no player has got a line of 3.

---

**Rock, Paper, Scissors**
A player faces off against the computer choosing rock, paper or scissors as their move. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.

---

**Matching Game**
In a grid of tiles, a player flips tiles until they find two that match. Once all tiles have been flipped and matched, the game ends.

---

You can build any game you like, this is an opportunity to put into practice everything you've learnt so far

---

**Plan** what you want to build

---

**Build** something which uses functions, event listeners, data structures, etc.

---

**Debug** until it works
