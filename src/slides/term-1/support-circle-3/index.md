## Project Gallery

---

### Requirements

---

- Implement CSS Flexbox to create a responsive 1 Directional Layout
- Implement responses to user input in JavaScript using event listeners

---

- Understand the purpose and benefits of JavaScript functions
- Write JavaScript functions, using parameters for varying arguments

---

## Flexbox

---

CSS Flexbox allows one-directional responsive layouts

---

This means you can add layouts to pages, in rows or columns

---

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: centre;
```

---

## Functions

---

A function can be defined as a set of instructions to complete a task

---

A function may take some input and return an output

---

### The benefits of using functions

---

**Define reusable code**

Declare code which can be used more than once with different inputs to give different outputs

---

**Modularise our code**

Break our code up into sections based on its purpose

---

**Help us understand our code**

Having a well named function is easier to understand than a list of statements

A meaningful name makes it easier to understand what the function does. A function that adds two numbers can be ‚ÄúaddTwoNumbers‚Äù

---

### Using functions

---

**Step one:** Declare the function

---

```js
function myFunction(parameterOne, parameterTwo) {
  // What my function does
}
```

---

```js
function multiplyTwoNumbers(numOne, numTwo) {
  return numOne * numTwo;
}
```

---

**Step two:** Call the function

---

```js
myFunction(argumentOne, argumentTwo);
```

---

```js
function multiplyTwoNumbers(numOne, numTwo) {
  return numOne * numTwo;
}

multiplyTwoNumbers(1, 4);
// returns 5
```
