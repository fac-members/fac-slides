# Application workshops

## 3. Codewars

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## Before we start...

---

We are removing the Codewars part of our course requirements

Completing the kata will no longer be required to apply to our course

---

### Why?

We've found that focusing on Codewars can be a distraction from learning how websites fit together

Also, the Codewars community can be hostile

---

We'll be replacing this portion of the requirements with our weekly prompts

---

In week 5, we'll look at git and GitHub as a way to share your code

We'll ask everyone to share their profile with us at FAC

---

You'll then have a record of your own learning and learn in a practical way

---

Bearing that in mind, we still recommend Codewars as a platform to practice solving problems

---

## Introduction

---

Codewars is a platform where you can complete coding challenges

---

By completing `kata` you earn `honor`

---

By gaining `honor` you progress through `kyu` or ranks

`Kyu` starts at `8kyu` and moves upwards to `1kyu`

---

## Getting started

---

Go to [codewars.com](codewars.com)

---

Sign in with GitHub

---

Solve the problem

---

## Solving the problem

---

Step one: find the right problem

---

Step two: Read the instructions carefully

---

Step three: Have a look at the inputs and outputs

---

Step four: move to [replit.com](replit.com)

---

Step five: Solve the problem

---

## Approaching problems

A four-step approach

---

### 1. Understand the problem

What is it asking you to do? What are the inputs and outputs?

---

### 2. Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps

Use JavaScript Comments

---

### 3. Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Remember to `console.log()` to check your code along the way.

---

### 4. Refactor

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

## Tips

---

Use `console.log()` often

---

Re-read the problem

---

Check your inputs and outputs

---

Check for syntax errors

---

Read the error message

---

## Challenges

---

We'll follow these steps:

1. Present a challenge
1. Take time to reflect and understand
1. I'll ask for pseudocode solutions
1. We'll write some JavaScript
1. We'll consider ways to refactor the code
