# FAC pre-course Week 4

---

## Daily learning

---

We believe it's important to build a habit of learning

---

The best way to do this is with small sessions every (working) day

---

### Active problem-solving

Warm up by writing some code before you start the day

(i.e. CodeWars or Execute Program)

---

### Passive learning

Finish the day by reading an interesting article.

Try to take notes as you go to reinforce the learning.

(Dan likes [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for turning notes into flashcards)

---

## Immersing yourself in tech

---

Code doesn't have to be your hobby,  
but it helps to immerse yourself in it

(for the duration of the course at least)

---

Helpful ways to immerse yourself:

- Meetups (remote)
- Conference talks (on YouTube)
- Twitter
- Blogs
- Codealong videos

---

You will absorb knowledge and culture from others in the industry

---

We will share lists of recommend Twitter accounts and blogs on Slack

---

## Pre-course project

---

Pomodoro timer!
