# Pre-apprenticeship

## Wednesday Week 3

---

<!-- {.primary} -->

Welcome back

---

## Programme Structure

---

Each week these workshops will give a brief introduction to the topic for the next two weeks

---

You'll work on a project for each topic, initally on your own and then in pairs

---

- **Weeks 3 & 4:** CSS layouts, architecture and variables
- **Weeks 5 & 6:** Git pairing, code review, estimation, objects and advanced DOM
- **Weeks 7 & 8:** Higher order functions, promises and fetch
- **Weeks 9 & 10:** Testing
- **Weeks 11 & 12:** Final project

---

Along the way, you'll get experience:

- Working with someone else asynchronously
- Estimating how long it will take to build features
- Handling user stories
- Reviewing code

---

## CSS Layouts

---

There are different methods for controlling layouts of web pages

---

- Tables
- Box model
- CSS: Flex box
- CSS: Grid

---

### The box model

---

> As Rachel Andrew has reminded us, everything in web design is a box, or the absence of a box... Layout is inevitably, therefore, the arrangement of boxes.

---

### CSS Grid

---

A two-dimensional layout composed of **rows** and **columns** separated by **gutters**.

---

<style>
.static-grid {
position: relative;
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 4rem);
grid-gap: 2rem;
}
.static-grid > * {
  color: black;
  background-color: hsl(180, 15%, 80%);
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
.label.row {
  background-color: hsla(0, 15%, 80%, 0.5);
  grid-row: 1 / 1;
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
.label.column {
  background-color: hsla(240, 15%, 80%, 0.5);
  grid-row: 1 / -1;
  grid-column: 1 / 1;
}
</style>
<div class="static-grid">
