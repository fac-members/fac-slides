## Motivation

---

You all have different levels of experience in different areas.

The pre-course is designed to ensure everyone starts the course with the fundamentals they need.

---

Some of you have more free time than others.

Please don't use this to try and get ahead.

---

Remember FAC prioritises collective learning over individual goals.

---

## Expectations

---

Since you're going to be working together we want to highlight our expectations of your behaviour.

---

### Recognise the space you take up.

---

If you're extroverted, loud, or opinionated, that's okay.

But be aware of how that might affect others.

There's limited time and space, especially on Zoom.

Don't use more than your fair share.

---

### Recognise your privileges.
