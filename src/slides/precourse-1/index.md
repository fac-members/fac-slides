### Weekly schedule

---

### Extras

There will be some extra resources to work through.

E.g. git/GitHub practice, SQL

It'll all be up on the new curriculum platform soon.

---

## Motivation

---

You all have different levels of experience in different areas.

The pre-course is designed to ensure everyone starts the course with the fundamentals they need.

---

Some of you have more free time than others.

Please don't use this to try and get ahead.

---

Remember FAC prioritises collective learning over individual goals.

---

## Expectations

---

You're going to be working together for the first time.

Working effectively in a diverse group requires work.

---

### Recognise the space you take up.

---

If you're extroverted or loud that's okay.

If you're introverted or quiet that's okay too.

We want everyone to have a voice in our discussions.

---

The onus should not (only) be on quiet people to make themselves heard.

There's limited time and space in groups, especially on Zoom.

Don't use more than your fair share.

---

Please read our Code of Conduct (again).

Remember this is _the bare minimum_.

It mostly defines unacceptable behaviour, and it's a low bar!
