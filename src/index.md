# Important changes this time

---

### 1. Right now the job market is tough

This year has been challenging. Things may improve in 2021, but take nothing for granted.

---

### 2. We are aiming offer (some) apprenticeships

We are in communication with a number of employers. Several are interested, but none has yet committed. We will be offering 16 places on our Spring 2021 programme. We do not yet know how many of those 16 will be able to secure an apprenticeship before they start.

---

### 3. Apprentice interviews will start in February

For successful applicants to our programme, apprentice interviews with employers are likely to start in February.

---

### 4. Apprentices and other applicants will study together

Although the apprentice programme may be only 12 weeks long. Other students will have the option to continue for longer.

---

### 5. Apprentice vs Entry-level pay

Typical entry-level salaries are around £30,000. Our apprentice salaries are probably going to be £24,000 (we think!). Taking into account the 3 months of paid study, that works out about the same. As well as being paid while you study, there may be a benefit in having the job interview stress before you start the programme instead of after you finish.
